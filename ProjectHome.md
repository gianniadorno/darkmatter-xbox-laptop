# Darkmatter - Arduino compatible Open source XBox Laptop Kit #

Darkmatter is a fully open source Arduino compatible, 3D printed, laser cut XBox 360 Laptop that you can build completely from scratch or assemble yourself from a kit. Inspired by Ben Heck’s one-off creations, we set out to build an Arduino based Xbox laptop kit which would make it easy as pie for anyone to hack their Xbox 360 and turn it into a fully functional gaming laptop. We think we have succeeded! Whether you’re a hardcore gamer or a budding maker, the Darkmatter xbox laptop is the perfect DIY project you could undertake.

Darkmatter lumps an LED screen, an XBox console, a capacitive touch interface and other
bits into a compact, portable laptop that you can carry around and play wherever you go. It is also completely customizable! From custom backlight colors to cool graphic skins, there’s a lot you can do to personalize your Darkmatter laptop. Since the project is open source, you can also build one yourself from scratch. All the source
code, design files and instructions are available on the project wiki for you to work with. You can use easily accessible services such as Ponoko, Shapeways or Techshop to make one yourself. Or you could simply get a Darkmatter kit and assemble one in a matter of hours. The “xduino360” arduino-compatible board that comes with the kit can also be used in any custom Xbox 360 laptop project to fulfill your modding fantasies.
